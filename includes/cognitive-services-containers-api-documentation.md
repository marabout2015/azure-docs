The container provides a full set of documentation for the endpoints as well as a `Try it now` feature. This feature allows you to enter your settings into a web-based HTML form and make the query without having to write any code. Once the query returns, an example CURL command is provided to demonstrate the HTTP headers and body format required. 

> [!TIP]
> Read the [OpenAPI specification](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/about/), describing the API operations supported by the container, from the `/swagger` relative URI. For example:
