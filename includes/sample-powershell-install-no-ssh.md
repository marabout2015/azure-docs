This sample requires the Azure PowerShell module version 5.1.1 or later. Run `Get-Module -ListAvailable AzureRM` to find the version. If you need to install or upgrade, see [Install Azure PowerShell module](/powershell/azure/azurerm/install-azurerm-ps). 

Run `Connect-AzureRmAccount` to create a connection with Azure.
