### Azure Active Directory Authentication

Azure Spatial Anchors also allows applications to authenticate with user Azure Active Directory tokens. For example, you can use AAD tokens to integrate with ASA. If an Enterprise maintains users in AAD, you can supply an user AAD token in the Azure Spatial Anchors SDK. Doing so allows you to authenticate directly to the ASA service for an account that's part of the same AAD tenant.
