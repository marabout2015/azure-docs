> [!NOTE]
> - The preview of Azure AD authentication for blobs and queues is intended for non-production use only. Production service-level agreements (SLAs) are not currently available. If Azure AD authentication is not yet supported for your scenario, continue to use Shared Key authorization or SAS tokens in your applications.
>
> - During the preview, RBAC role assignments may take up to five minutes to propagate.
>
> - To authorize blob and queue operations with an OAuth token, you must use HTTPS.
>
> - The Azure portal now supports using Azure AD credentials to read and write blob and queue data, as part of the preview release. To access blob and queue data in the Azure portal, a user must be assigned the Azure Resource Manager Reader RBAC role, in addition to the appropriate preview role for blob or queue access. For more information, see [Grant access to Azure containers and queues with RBAC in the Azure portal (preview)](../articles/storage/common/storage-auth-aad-rbac.md). 
> 
> - [Azure Storage Explorer](https://azure.microsoft.com/features/storage-explorer/) currently uses your storage account key to access blob and queue data. OAuth access is supported for blobs.
>
> - Azure Files supports authentication with Azure AD over SMB for domain-joined VMs only (preview). To learn about using Azure AD over SMB for Azure Files, see [Overview of Azure Active Directory authentication over SMB for Azure Files (preview)](../articles/storage/files/storage-files-active-directory-overview.md).
