# Tutorial: Azure Active Directory integration with Infinite Campus

In this tutorial, you learn how to integrate Infinite Campus with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD).

Integrating Infinite Campus with Azure AD provides you with the following benefits:

- You can control in Azure AD who has access to Infinite Campus.
- You can enable your users to automatically get signed-on to Infinite Campus (Single Sign-On) with their Azure AD accounts.
- You can manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.

If you want to know more details about SaaS app integration with Azure AD, see [what is application access and single sign-on with Azure Active Directory](../manage-apps/what-is-single-sign-on.md)

## Prerequisites

To configure Azure AD integration with Infinite Campus, you need the following items:

- An Azure AD subscription
- An Infinite Campus single sign-on enabled subscription

> [!NOTE]
> To test the steps in this tutorial, we do not recommend using a production environment.

To test the steps in this tutorial, you should follow these recommendations:

- Do not use your production environment, unless it is necessary.
- If you don't have an Azure AD trial environment, you can [get a one-month trial](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial/).
- At minimum, you need to be an Azure Active Directory administrator, and have a Campus Product Security Role of "Student Information System (SIS)" to complete the configuration.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you test Azure AD single sign-on in a test environment. 
The scenario outlined in this tutorial consists of two main building blocks:

1. Adding Infinite Campus from the gallery
2. Configuring and testing Azure AD single sign-on

## Adding Infinite Campus from the gallery

To configure the integration of Infinite Campus into Azure AD, you need to add Infinite Campus from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

**To add Infinite Campus from the gallery, perform the following steps:**

1. In the **[Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com)**, on the left navigation panel, click **Azure Active Directory** icon. 

	![The Azure Active Directory button][1]

2. Navigate to **Enterprise applications**. Then go to **All applications**.

	![The Enterprise applications blade][2]

3. To add new application, click **New application** button on the top of dialog.

	![The New application button][3]

4. In the search box, type **Infinite Campus**, select **Infinite Campus** from result panel then click **Add** button to add the application.

## Configure and test Azure AD single sign-on

In this section, you configure and test Azure AD single sign-on with Infinite Campus based on a test user called "Britta Simon".

For single sign-on to work, Azure AD needs to know what the counterpart user in Infinite Campus is to a user in Azure AD. In other words, a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in Infinite Campus needs to be established.

To configure and test Azure AD single sign-on with Infinite Campus, you need to complete the following building blocks:

1. **[Configuring Azure AD Single Sign-On](#configuring-azure-ad-single-sign-on)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
2. **[Creating an Azure AD test user](#creating-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Azure AD single sign-on with Britta Simon.
3. **[Creating an Infinite Campus test user](#creating-a-infinite-campus-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of Britta Simon in Infinite Campus that is linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
4. **[Assigning the Azure AD test user](#assigning-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable Britta Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
5. **[Testing single sign-on](#testing-single-sign-on)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

### Configuring Azure AD single sign-on

In this section, you enable Azure AD single sign-on in the Azure portal and configure single sign-on in your Infinite Campus application.

**To configure Azure AD single sign-on with Infinite Campus, perform the following steps:**

1. In the Azure portal, on the **Infinite Campus** application integration page, click **Single sign-on**.

	![Configure single sign-on link][4]

	![image](./media/infinitecampus-tutorial/tutorial_infinitecampus_url.png)

	d. In the **Sign-on URL** textbox, type a URL using the following pattern (the domain will vary with Hosting Model): `https://<DOMAIN>.infinitecampus.com/campus/SSO/<DISTRICTNAME>/SIS`

5. If you do not have **Service Provider metadata file**, perform the following steps (note that the domain will vary with Hosting Model):

	a. In the **Sign-on URL** textbox, type a URL using the following pattern: `https://<DOMAIN>.infinitecampus.com/campus/SSO/<DISTRICTNAME>/SIS`

	b. In the **Identifier** textbox, type a URL using the following pattern: `https://<DOMAIN>.infinitecampus.com/campus/<DISTRICTNAME>`

	c. In the **Reply URL** textbox, type a URL using the following pattern: `https://<DOMAIN>.infinitecampus.com/campus/SSO/<DISTRICTNAME>`
