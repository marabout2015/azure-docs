# Tutorial: Azure Active Directory integration with Peakon

In this tutorial, you learn how to integrate Peakon with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD).

Integrating Peakon with Azure AD provides you with the following benefits:

- You can control in Azure AD who has access to Peakon.
- You can enable your users to automatically get signed-on to Peakon (Single Sign-On) with their Azure AD accounts.
- You can manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.

If you want to know more details about SaaS app integration with Azure AD, see [what is application access and single sign-on with Azure Active Directory](../manage-apps/what-is-single-sign-on.md)

## Prerequisites

To configure Azure AD integration with Peakon, you need the following items:

- An Azure AD subscription
- A Peakon single sign-on enabled subscription

> [!NOTE]
> To test the steps in this tutorial, we do not recommend using a production environment.

To test the steps in this tutorial, you should follow these recommendations:

- Do not use production environment, unless it is necessary.
- If you don't have an Azure AD trial environment, you can [get a one-month trial](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial/).

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you test Azure AD single sign-on in a test environment. 
The scenario outlined in this tutorial consists of two main building blocks:

1. Adding Peakon from the gallery
2. Configuring and testing Azure AD single sign-on

## Adding Peakon from the gallery

To configure the integration of Peakon into Azure AD, you need to add Peakon from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

**To add Peakon from the gallery, perform the following steps:**

1. In the **[Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com)**, on the left navigation panel, click **Azure Active Directory** icon. 

	![The Azure Active Directory button][1]

2. Navigate to **Enterprise applications**. Then go to **All applications**.

	![The Enterprise applications blade][2]

3. To add new application, click **New application** button on the top of dialog.

	![The New application button][3]

4. In the search box, type **Peakon**, select **Peakon** from result panel then click **Add** button to add the application.

	![Peakon in the results list](./media/peakon-tutorial/tutorial_peakon_addfromgallery.png)

## Configure and test Azure AD single sign-on

In this section, you configure and test Azure AD single sign-on with Peakon based on a test user called "Britta Simon".

For single sign-on to work, Azure AD needs to know what the counterpart user in Peakon is to a user in Azure AD. In other words, a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in Peakon needs to be established.

To configure and test Azure AD single sign-on with Peakon, you need to complete the following building blocks:

1. **[Configuring Azure AD Single Sign-On](#configuring-azure-ad-single-sign-on)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
2. **[Creating an Azure AD test user](#creating-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Azure AD single sign-on with Britta Simon.
3. **[Creating a Peakon test user](#creating-a-peakon-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of Britta Simon in Peakon that is linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
4. **[Assigning the Azure AD test user](#assigning-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable Britta Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
5. **[Testing single sign-on](#testing-single-sign-on)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

### Configuring Azure AD single sign-on

In this section, you enable Azure AD single sign-on in the Azure portal and configure single sign-on in your Peakon application.

**To configure Azure AD single sign-on with Peakon, perform the following steps:**

1. In the Azure portal, on the **Peakon** application integration page, click **Single sign-on**.

	![Configure single sign-on link][4]

2. On the **Select a Single sign-on method** dialog, Click **Select** for **SAML** mode to enable single sign-on.

5. Click **Set additional URLs** and perform the following step if you wish to configure the application in **SP** initiated mode:

	![Peakon Domain and URLs single sign-on information](./media/peakon-tutorial/tutorial_peakon_url1.png)

    In the **Sign-on URL** textbox, type a URL: `https://app.peakon.com/login`

	> [!NOTE]
	> These values are not real. Update these values with the actual Identifier and Reply URL which is explained latert in the tutorial.

6. In the **SAML Signing Certificate** section, click **Download** to download **Certificate (Raw)** and then save certificate file on your computer.
