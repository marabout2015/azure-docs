# Tutorial: How to download and use a script to access sign-in logs

You can download the sign-in activities data if you want work with it outside the Azure portal. The **Download** option in the Azure portal creates a CSV file of the most recent 5000 records. If you need more flexibility, for instance, to download more than 5000 records at a time, or to download the logs at scheduled intervals, you can use the **Script** button to generate a PowerShell script to download your data.

In this tutorial, you learn how to generate a script to download all the sign-in logs from the last 24 hours and schedule it to run every day. 

## Prerequisites

You need

* An Azure Active Directory tenant with a premium (P1/P2) license. Note that if you did not have any activities data prior to the upgrade, it will take a couple of days for the data to show up in the reports after you upgrade to a premium license. 
* A user, who is in the **global administrator**, **security administrator**, **security reader** or **report reader** role for the tenant. In addition, any user can access their own sign-ins. 

## Tutorial

1. Navigate to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) and select your directory.
2. Select **Azure Active Directory** and select **Sign-ins** from the **Monitoring** section. 
3. Use the **Date Range** filter drop-down and select **24 Hours** to get data from the last 24 hours. 
4. Select **Apply** and verify that the filter is applied as expected. 
5. Select **Script** from the top menu to download the Powershell script with the applied filters.

6. Open the **Task Scheduler** application on your Windows machine and select **Create Basic Task**.
7. Enter a name and description for the task and click **Next**.
8. Select the **Daily** radio button to allow the task to run daily and enter the start date and time.
9. In the action menu, select **Start a program** and select the downloaded script and select **Next**. 
10. Review the scheduled task and select **Finish** to create the task.

Now, your task will run every day and save the sign-in records from the last 24 hours into a file of the format **AAD_SignInReport_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.csv**. You can also edit the downloaded PowerShell script to save it under a different file name, or to modify the number of records downloaded.
