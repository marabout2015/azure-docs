# Services that support managed identities for Azure resources

Managed identities for Azure resources provide Azure services with an automatically managed identity in Azure Active Directory. Using a managed identity, you can authenticate to any service that supports Azure AD authentication without having credentials in your code. We are in the process of integrating managed identities for Azure resources and Azure AD authentication across Azure. Check back often for updates.

> [!NOTE]
> Managed identities for Azure resources is the new name for the service formerly known as Managed Service Identity (MSI).

## Azure services that support managed identities for Azure resources

The following Azure services support managed identities for Azure resources:
