# Consent to LinkedIn integration for your Azure Active Directory organization

In this article, you can learn how to enable or disable LinkedIn integration for your organization in the Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) admin center.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The LinkedIn integration setting is currently being rolled out to Azure AD organizations. When it is rolled out to your organization, it is enabled by default.
> 
> Exceptions:
> * The setting is not available for customers using Microsoft Cloud for US Government, Microsoft Cloud Germany, or Azure and Office 365 operated by 21Vianet in China.
> * The setting is off by default for tenants provisioned in Germany. Note that the setting is not available for customers using Microsoft Cloud Germany.
> * The setting is off by default for tenants provisioned in France.
>
> The integration works only if you have it enabled *and* after users consent to apps accessing company data on their behalf. For information about the user consent setting, see [How to remove a userâ€™s access to an application](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/application-access-assignment-how-to-remove-assignment).

You can enable or disable LinkedIn integration for your entire tenant or for only selected users in your tenant.

1. Sign in to the [Azure Active Directory admin center](https://aad.portal.azure.com/) with an account that's a global admin for the Azure AD tenant.
2. Select **Users**.
3. On the **Users** blade, select **User settings**.
4. Under **LinkedIn account connections**:

   * Select **Yes** to consent for all users in the organization to connect their accounts to get access to their LinkedIn contacts within some Microsoft apps.
   * Select **Selected** to consent for only selected users in the organization to connect their accounts to get access to their LinkedIn contacts within some Microsoft apps.
   * Select **No** to withdraw consent for users in your organization to connect their accounts to get access to their LinkedIn contacts within some Microsoft apps.

2. Extract the **ADMX** files and copy them to your central store.
3. Open Group Policy Management.
4. Create a Group Policy Object with the following setting: **User Configuration** > **Administrative Templates** > **Microsoft Office 2016** > **Miscellaneous** > **Show LinkedIn features in Office applications**.
5. Select **Enabled** or **Disabled**.
  
   State | Effect
   ------ | ------
   **Enabled** | The **Show LinkedIn features in Office applications** setting in Office 2016 Options is enabled. Users in your organization can use LinkedIn features in their Office applications.
   **Disabled** | The **Show LinkedIn features in Office applications** setting in Office 2016 Options is disabled and end users can't change this setting. Users in your organization can't use LinkedIn features in their Office 2016 applications.

This group policy affects only Office 2016 apps for a local computer. Users can see LinkedIn features in profile cards throughout Office 365 even if they disable LinkedIn in their Office 2016 apps.
