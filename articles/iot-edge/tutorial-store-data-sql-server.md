# Tutorial: Store data at the edge with SQL Server databases

Use Azure IoT Edge and SQL Server to store and query data at the edge. Azure IoT Edge has basic storage capabilities to cache messages if a device goes offline, and then forward them when the connection is reestablished. However, you may want more advanced storage capabilities, like being able to query data locally. By incorporating local databases, your IoT Edge devices can perform more complex computing without having to maintain a connection to IoT Hub. For example, a sensor on a machine uploads data to the cloud once a month for reporting and improving a machine learning module. However, if a field technician is working on the machine, they can access the last few days of sensor data locally.

This article provides instructions for deploying a SQL Server database to an IoT Edge device. Azure Functions, running on the IoT Edge device, structures the incoming data then sends it to the database. The steps in this article can also be applied to other databases that work in containers, like MySQL or PostgreSQL.

In this tutorial, you learn how to:

> * View generated data

[!INCLUDE [quickstarts-free-trial-note](../../includes/quickstarts-free-trial-note.md)]

## Prerequisites

An Azure IoT Edge device:

* You can use your development machine or a virtual machine as an Edge device by following the steps in the quickstart for [Linux](quickstart-linux.md) or [Windows devices](quickstart.md).

  > [!NOTE]
  > SQL Server only supports Linux containers. If you want to test this tutorial by using a Windows device as your Edge device, you must configure it so that it uses Linux containers. See [Install Azure IoT Edge runtime on Windows](how-to-install-iot-edge-windows-with-linux.md) for the prerequisites and installation steps for configuring the IoT Edge runtime for Linux containers on Windows.

Cloud resources:

* A free or standard-tier [IoT Hub](../iot-hub/iot-hub-create-through-portal.md) in Azure. 

Development resources:

* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). 
* [C# for Visual Studio Code (powered by OmniSharp) extension for Visual Studio Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.csharp). 
* [Azure IoT Tools for Visual Studio Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vsciot-vscode.azure-iot-edge). 
* [.NET Core 2.1 SDK](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download). 
* [Docker CE](https://docs.docker.com/install/). 

## Create a container registry

In this tutorial, you use the Azure IoT Tools for Visual Studio Code to build a module and create a **container image** from the files. Then you push this image to a **registry** that stores and manages your images. Finally, you deploy your image from your registry to run on your IoT Edge device.  

You can use any Docker-compatible registry to hold your container images. Two popular Docker registry services are [Azure Container Registry](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/container-registry/) and [Docker Hub](https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/repos/#viewing-repository-tags). This tutorial uses Azure Container Registry. 

If you don't already have a container registry, follow these steps to create a new one in Azure:

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), select **Create a resource** > **Containers** > **Container Registry**.

2. Provide the following values to create your container registry:

   | Field | Value | 
   | ----- | ----- |
   | Registry name | Provide a unique name. |
   | Subscription | Select a subscription from the drop-down list. |
   | Resource group | We recommend that you use the same resource group for all of the test resources that you create during the IoT Edge quickstarts and tutorials. For example, **IoTEdgeResources**. |
   | Location | Choose a location close to you. |
   | Admin user | Set to **Enable**. |
   | SKU | Select **Basic**. | 

5. Select **Create**.

6. After your container registry is created, browse to it, and then select **Access keys**. 

7. Copy the values for **Login server**, **Username**, and **Password**. You use these values later in the tutorial to provide access to the container registry.  

## Create a function project

To send data into a database, you need a module that can structure the data properly and then stores it in a table. 

The following steps show you how to create an IoT Edge function using Visual Studio Code and the Azure IoT Tools.

1. Open Visual Studio Code.

2. Open the VS Code command palette by selecting **View** > **Command palette**.

3. In the command palette, type and run the command **Azure IoT Edge: New IoT Edge solution**. In the command palette, provide the following information to create your solution: 

   | Field | Value |
   | ----- | ----- |
   | Select folder | Choose the location on your development machine for VS Code to create the solution files. |
   | Provide a solution name | Enter a descriptive name for your solution, like **SqlSolution**, or accept the default. |
   | Select module template | Choose **Azure Functions - C#**. |
   | Provide a module name | Name your module **sqlFunction**. |
   | Provide Docker image repository for the module | An image repository includes the name of your container registry and the name of your container image. Your container image is prepopulated from the last step. Replace **localhost:5000** with the login server value from your Azure container registry. You can retrieve the login server from the Overview page of your container registry in the Azure portal. The final string looks like \<registry name\>.azurecr.io/sqlFunction. |

   The VS Code window loads your IoT Edge solution workspace. 
   
4. In your IoT Edge solution, open the \.env file. 

   Whenever you create a new IoT Edge solution, VS Code prompts you to provide your registry credentials in the \.env file. This file is git-ignored, and the IoT Edge extension uses it later to provide registry access to your IoT Edge device. 

   If you didn't provide your container registry in the previous step but accepted the default localhost:5000, you won't have a \.env file.

5. In the .env file, give the IoT Edge runtime your registry credentials so that it can access your module images. Find the **CONTAINER_REGISTRY_USERNAME** and **CONTAINER_REGISTRY_PASSWORD** sections and insert your credentials after the equals symbol: 

   ```env
   CONTAINER_REGISTRY_USERNAME_yourregistry=<username>
   CONTAINER_REGISTRY_PASSWORD_yourregistry=<password>
   ```

6. Save the .env file.

7. In the VS Code explorer, open **modules** > **sqlFunction** > **sqlFunction.cs**.

8. Replace the contents of the file with the following code:

   ```csharp
   using System;
   using System.Collections.Generic;
   using System.IO;
   using System.Text;
   using System.Threading.Tasks;
   using Microsoft.Azure.Devices.Client;
   using Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs;
   using Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Extensions.EdgeHub;
   using Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Host;
   using Microsoft.Extensions.Logging;
   using Newtonsoft.Json;
   using Sql = System.Data.SqlClient;

   namespace Functions.Samples
   {
       public static class sqlFunction
       {
           [FunctionName("sqlFunction")]
           public static async Task FilterMessageAndSendMessage(
               [EdgeHubTrigger("input1")] Message messageReceived,
               [EdgeHub(OutputName = "output1")] IAsyncCollector<Message> output,
               ILogger logger)
           {
               const int temperatureThreshold = 20;
               byte[] messageBytes = messageReceived.GetBytes();
               var messageString = System.Text.Encoding.UTF8.GetString(messageBytes);

               if (!string.IsNullOrEmpty(messageString))
               {
                   logger.LogInformation("Info: Received one non-empty message");
                   // Get the body of the message and deserialize it.
                   var messageBody = JsonConvert.DeserializeObject<MessageBody>(messageString);

                   //Store the data in SQL db
                   const string str = "<sql connection string>";
                   using (Sql.SqlConnection conn = new Sql.SqlConnection(str))
                   {
                       conn.Open();
                       var insertMachineTemperature = "INSERT INTO MeasurementsDB.dbo.TemperatureMeasurements VALUES (CONVERT(DATETIME2,'" + messageBody.timeCreated + "', 127), 'machine', " + messageBody.machine.temperature + ");";
                       var insertAmbientTemperature = "INSERT INTO MeasurementsDB.dbo.TemperatureMeasurements VALUES (CONVERT(DATETIME2,'" + messageBody.timeCreated + "', 127), 'ambient', " + messageBody.ambient.temperature + ");"; 
                       using (Sql.SqlCommand cmd = new Sql.SqlCommand(insertMachineTemperature + "\n" + insertAmbientTemperature, conn))
                       {
                           //Execute the command and log the # rows affected.
                           var rows = await cmd.ExecuteNonQueryAsync();
                           logger.LogInformation($"{rows} rows were updated");
                       }
                   }

                   if (messageBody != null && messageBody.machine.temperature > temperatureThreshold)
                   {
                       // Send the message to the output as the temperature value is greater than the threashold.
                       var filteredMessage = new Message(messageBytes);
                       // Copy the properties of the original message into the new Message object.
                       foreach (KeyValuePair<string, string> prop in messageReceived.Properties)
                       {filteredMessage.Properties.Add(prop.Key, prop.Value);}
                       // Add a new property to the message to indicate it is an alert.
                       filteredMessage.Properties.Add("MessageType", "Alert");
                       // Send the message.       
                       await output.AddAsync(filteredMessage);
                       logger.LogInformation("Info: Received and transferred a message with temperature above the threshold");
                   }
               }
           }
       }
       //Define the expected schema for the body of incoming messages.
       class MessageBody
       {
           public Machine machine {get; set;}
           public Ambient ambient {get; set;}
           public string timeCreated {get; set;}
       }
       class Machine
       {
           public double temperature {get; set;}
           public double pressure {get; set;}         
       }
       class Ambient
       {
           public double temperature {get; set;}
           public int humidity {get; set;}         
       }
   }
   ```

6. In line 35, replace the string **\<sql connection string\>** with the following string. The **Data Source** property references the SQL Server container name, which you create with the name **SQL** in the next section. 

   ```csharp
   Data Source=tcp:sql,1433;Initial Catalog=MeasurementsDB;User Id=SA;Password=Strong!Passw0rd;TrustServerCertificate=False;Connection Timeout=30;
   ```

7. Save the **sqlFunction.cs** file. 

8. Open the **sqlFunction.csproj** file.

9. Find the group of package references, and add a new one for SqlClient include. 

   ```csproj
   <PackageReference Include="System.Data.SqlClient" Version="4.5.1"/>
   ```

10. Save the **sqlFunction.csproj** file.

## Add a SQL Server container

A [Deployment manifest](module-composition.md) declares which modules the IoT Edge runtime will install on your IoT Edge device. You provided the code to make a customized Function module in the previous section, but the SQL Server module is already built. You just need to tell the IoT Edge runtime to include it, then configure it on your device. 

1. In the Visual Studio Code explorer, open the **deployment.template.json** file. 

1. Find the **modules** section. There should be two modules listed: **tempSensor**, which generates simulated data, and your **sqlFunction** module.

1. Add the following code to declare a third module. Add a comma after the sqlFunction section and insert:

   ```json
   "sql": {
     "version": "1.0",
     "type": "docker",
     "status": "running",
     "restartPolicy": "always",
     "env":{},
     "settings": {
       "image": "",
       "createOptions": ""
     }
   }
   ```

   ![Add SQL server module to manifest](./media/tutorial-store-data-sql-server/view_json_sql.png)

1. Update the **sql** module parameters with the following code:
      ```json
      "env": {
        "ACCEPT_EULA": {"value": "Y"},
        "SA_PASSWORD": {"value": "Strong!Passw0rd"}
      },
      "settings": {
        "image": "mcr.microsoft.com/mssql/server:latest",
        "createOptions": {
          "HostConfig": {
            "Mounts": [{"Target": "/var/opt/mssql","Source": "sqlVolume","Type": "volume"}],
            "PortBindings": {
              "1433/tcp": [{"HostPort": "1401"}]
            }
          }
        }
      }
      ```

   >[!Tip]
   >Any time that you create a SQL Server container in a production environment, you should [change the default system administrator password](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/linux/quickstart-install-connect-docker).

1. Save the **deployment.template.json** file.

## Build your IoT Edge solution

In the previous sections, you created a solution with one module, and then added another to the deployment manifest template. Now, you need to build the solution, create container images for the modules, and push the images to your container registry. 

1. Sign in to your container registry in Visual Studio Code so that you can push your images to your registry. Use the same credentials that you added to the .env file. Enter the following command in the integrated terminal:

    ```csh/sh
    docker login -u <ACR username> <ACR login server>
    ```
    
    You are prompted for the password. Paste your password into the prompt (your password is hidden for security) and press **Enter**. 

    ```csh/sh
    Password: <paste in the ACR password and press enter>
    Login Succeeded
    ```

2. In the VS Code explorer, right-click the **deployment.template.json** file and select **Build and Push IoT Edge solution**. 

When you tell Visual Studio Code to build your solution, it first takes the information in the deployment template and generates a deployment.json file in a new folder named **config**. Then, it runs two commands in the integrated terminal: `docker build` and `docker push`. These two commands build your code, containerize the module, and then push the code to the container registry that you specified when you initialized the solution. 

## Deploy the solution to a device

You can set modules on a device through the IoT Hub, but you can also access your IoT Hub and devices through Visual Studio Code. In this section, you set up access to your IoT Hub then use VS Code to deploy your solution to your IoT Edge device. 

1. In the VS Code command palette, select **Azure IoT Hub: Select IoT Hub**.

2. Follow the prompts to sign in to your Azure account. 

3. In the command palette, select your Azure subscription then select your IoT Hub. 

4. In the VS Code explorer, expand the **Azure IoT Hub Devices** section. 

5. Right-click on the device that you want to target with your deployment and select **Create deployment for single device**. 

   ![Create deployment for single device](./media/tutorial-store-data-sql-server/create-deployment.png)

6. In the file explorer, navigate to the **config** folder inside your solution and choose **deployment.amd64**. Click **Select Edge deployment manifest**. 

If the deployment is successful, a confirmation message is printed in the VS Code output. 

Refresh the status of your device in the Azure IoT Hub Devices section of VS Code. The new modules are listed and will start to report as running over the next few minutes as the containers are installed and started. You can also check to see that all the modules are up and running on your device. On your IoT Edge device, run the following command to see the status of the modules. 

   ```cmd/sh
   iotedge list
   ```

## Create the SQL database

When you apply the deployment manifest to your device, you get three modules running. The tempSensor module generates simulated environment data. The sqlFunction module takes the data and formats it for a database. This section guides you through setting up the SQL database to store the temperature data. 

Run the following commands on your IoT Edge device. These commands connect to the **sql** module running on your device and create a database and table to hold the temperature data being sent to it. 

1. In a command-line tool on your IoT Edge device, connect to your database. 
      ```bash
      sudo docker exec -it sql bash
      ```

2. Open the SQL command tool.
      ```bash
      /opt/mssql-tools/bin/sqlcmd -S localhost -U SA -P 'Strong!Passw0rd'
      ```

3. Create your database: 
      ```sql
      CREATE DATABASE MeasurementsDB
      ON
      (NAME = MeasurementsDB, FILENAME = '/var/opt/mssql/measurementsdb.mdf')
      GO
      ```

4. Define your table.

   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE MeasurementsDB.dbo.TemperatureMeasurements (measurementTime DATETIME2, location NVARCHAR(50), temperature FLOAT)
   GO
   ```

You can customize your SQL Server docker file to automatically set up your SQL Server to be deployed on multiple IoT Edge devices. For more information, see the [Microsoft SQL Server container demo project](https://github.com/twright-msft/mssql-node-docker-demo-app). 

## View the local data

Once your table is created, the sqlFunction module starts storing data in a local SQL Server 2017 database on your IoT Edge device. 

From inside the SQL command tool, run the following command to view your formatted table data: 

   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM MeasurementsDB.dbo.TemperatureMeasurements
   GO
   ```

   ![View contents of local database](./media/tutorial-store-data-sql-server/view-data.png)



## Clean up resources

If you plan to continue to the next recommended article, you can keep the resources and configurations that you created and reuse them. You can also keep using the same IoT Edge device as a test device. 

Otherwise, you can delete the local configurations and the Azure resources that you created in this article to avoid charges.

[!INCLUDE [iot-edge-clean-up-local-resources](../../includes/iot-edge-clean-up-local-resources.md)]



## Next steps

In this tutorial, you created an Azure Functions module that contains code to filter raw data generated by your IoT Edge device. When you're ready to build your own modules, you can learn more about how to [Develop Azure Functions with Azure IoT Edge for Visual Studio Code](how-to-develop-csharp-function.md).
