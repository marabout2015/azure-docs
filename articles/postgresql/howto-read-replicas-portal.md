# Create and manage read replicas from the Azure portal

In this article, you learn how to create and manage read replicas in Azure Database for PostgreSQL from the Azure portal. To learn more about read replicas, see the [overview](concepts-read-replicas.md).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The read replica feature is in public preview.

## Prerequisites
An [Azure Database for PostgreSQL server](quickstart-create-server-database-portal.md) to be the master server.

## Prepare the master server
These steps must be used to prepare a master server in the General Purpose or Memory Optimized tiers.

The `azure.replication_support` parameter must be set to **REPLICA** on the master server. When this parameter is changed, a server restart is required for the change to take effect.

1. In the Azure portal, select the existing Azure Database for PostgreSQL server to use as a master.

2. On the left menu, select **Server Parameters**.

3. Search for the `azure.replication_support` parameter.

   ![Search for the azure.replication_support parameter](./media/howto-read-replicas-portal/azure-replication-parameter.png)

4. Set the `azure.replication_support` parameter value to **REPLICA**. Select **Save** to keep your changes.

   ![Set the parameter to REPLICA and save your changes](./media/howto-read-replicas-portal/save-parameter-replica.png)

5. After you save your changes, you receive a notification:

   ![Save notification](./media/howto-read-replicas-portal/parameter-save-notification.png)

6. Restart the server to apply your changes. To learn how to restart a server, see [Restart an Azure Database for PostgreSQL server](howto-restart-server-portal.md).


## Create a read replica
To create a read replica, follow these steps:

1. Select the existing Azure Database for PostgreSQL server to use as the master server. 

2. On the server menu, under **SETTINGS**, select **Replication**.

   If you haven't set the `azure.replication_support` parameter to **REPLICA** on a General Purpose or Memory Optimized master server and restarted the server, you receive a notification. Complete those steps before you create the replica.

3. Select **Add Replica**.

   ![Add a replica](./media/howto-read-replicas-portal/add-replica.png)

4. Enter a name for the read replica. Select **OK** to confirm the creation of the replica.

   ![Name the replica](./media/howto-read-replicas-portal/name-replica.png) 

A replica is created by using the same server configuration as the master. After a replica is created, several settings can be changed independently from the master server: compute generation, vCores, storage, and back-up retention period. The pricing tier can also be changed independently, except to or from the Basic tier.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Before a master server configuration is updated to new values, update the replica configuration to equal or greater values. This action ensures the replica can keep up with any changes made to the master.

After the read replica is created, it can be viewed from the **Replication** window:

## Stop replication
You can stop replication between a master server and a read replica.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> After you stop replication to a master server and a read replica, it can't be undone. The read replica becomes a standalone server that supports both reads and writes. The standalone server can't be made into a replica again.

To stop replication between a master server and a read replica from the Azure portal, follow these steps:

1. In the Azure portal, select your master Azure Database for PostgreSQL server.

2. On the server menu, under **SETTINGS**, select **Replication**.

3. Select the replica server for which to stop replication.

   ![Select the replica](./media/howto-read-replicas-portal/select-replica.png)
 
4. Select **Stop replication**.

   ![Select stop replication](./media/howto-read-replicas-portal/select-stop-replication.png)
 
5. Select **OK** to stop replication.

   ![Confirm to stop replication](./media/howto-read-replicas-portal/confirm-stop-replication.png)
 

## Delete a master server
To delete a master server, you use the same steps as to delete a standalone Azure Database for PostgreSQL server. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When you delete a master server, replication to all read replicas is stopped. The read replicas become standalone servers that now support both reads and writes.

To delete a server from the Azure portal, follow these steps:

1. In the Azure portal, select your master Azure Database for PostgreSQL server.

2. Open the **Overview** page for the server. Select **Delete**.

   ![On the server Overview page, select to delete the master server](./media/howto-read-replicas-portal/delete-server.png)
 
3. Enter the name of the master server to delete. Select **Delete** to confirm deletion of the master server.

   ![Confirm to delete the master server](./media/howto-read-replicas-portal/confirm-delete.png)
 

## Delete a replica
You can delete a read replica similar to how you delete a master server.

- In the Azure portal, open the **Overview** page for the read replica. Select **Delete**.

   ![On the replica Overview page, select to delete the replica](./media/howto-read-replicas-portal/delete-replica.png)
 
You can also delete the read replica from the **Replication** window by following these steps:

1. In the Azure portal, select your master Azure Database for PostgreSQL server.

2. On the server menu, under **SETTINGS**, select **Replication**.

3. Select the read replica to delete.

   ![Select the replica to delete](./media/howto-read-replicas-portal/select-replica.png)
 
4. Select **Delete replica**.

   ![Select delete replica](./media/howto-read-replicas-portal/select-delete-replica.png)
 
5. Enter the name of the replica to delete. Select **Delete** to confirm deletion of the replica.

## Monitor a replica
Two metrics are available to monitor read replicas.

### Max Lag Across Replicas metric
The **Max Lag Across Replicas** metric shows the lag in bytes between the master server and the most-lagging replica. 

1.	In the Azure portal, select the master Azure Database for PostgreSQL server.

2.	Select **Metrics**. In the **Metrics** window, select **Max Lag Across Replicas**.

    ![Monitor the max lag across replicas](./media/howto-read-replicas-portal/select-max-lag.png)
 
3.	For your **Aggregation**, select **Max**.


### Replica Lag metric
The **Replica Lag** metric shows the time since the last replayed transaction on a replica. If there are no transactions occurring on your master, the metric reflects this time lag.

1. In the Azure portal, select the Azure Database for PostgreSQL read replica.

2. Select **Metrics**. In the **Metrics** window, select **Replica Lag**.

3. For your **Aggregation**, select **Max**.
