# Let human reviewers review images

After you have signed up for Content Moderation and obtained a subscription key, you can try out the image review features.

2. Click the Try tab, and upload some images to review.
3. Click the Review tab and select Image.

   The images display with any labels that have been assigned by the review tool. The images are not available to other reviewers in your team while you are reviewing them.

4. Move the “Reviews to display” slider (1) to adjust the number of images displayed on the screen. Click on the tagged or untagged buttons (2) to sort the images accordingly. Click on a tag (3) to toggle it on or off.

7. Once you have reviewed and updated the tag assignments as needed, click **Next** to submit your reviews.

After you submit, you have about five seconds to click the **Prev** button to return to the previous screen and review images again. After that, the images are no longer in the Submit queue and the **Prev** button is no longer available.
