# API Reference

The Azure Face API is a cloud-based API that provides algorithms for face detection and recognition. The Face APIs comprise the following categories:

- [Face Algorithm APIs](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/cognitiveservices/face/face): Covers core functions such as [Detection](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/cognitiveservices/face/face/detectwithstream), [Find Similar](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/cognitiveservices/face/face/findsimilar), [Verification](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/cognitiveservices/face/face/verifyfacetoface), [Identification](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/cognitiveservices/face/face/identify), and [Group](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/cognitiveservices/face/face/group).
- [FaceList Management APIs](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/cognitiveservices/face/facelist): Used to manage a FaceList for [Find Similar](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/cognitiveservices/face/face/findsimilar).
- [LargePersonGroup Person Management APIs](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/cognitiveservices/face/largepersongroupperson): Used to manage LargePersonGroup Person Faces for [Identification](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/cognitiveservices/face/face/identify).
- [LargePersonGroup Management APIs](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/cognitiveservices/face/largepersongroup): Used to manage a LargePersonGroup dataset for [Identification](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/cognitiveservices/face/face/identify).
- [LargeFaceList Management APIs](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/cognitiveservices/face/largefacelist): Used to manage a LargeFaceList for [Find Similar](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/cognitiveservices/face/face/findsimilar).
- [PersonGroup Person Management APIs](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/cognitiveservices/face/persongroupperson): Used to manage PersonGroup Person Faces for [Identification](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/cognitiveservices/face/face/identify).
- [PersonGroup Management APIs](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/cognitiveservices/face/persongroup): Used to manage a PersonGroup dataset for [Identification](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/cognitiveservices/face/face/identify).
- [Snapshot Management APIs](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/cognitiveservices/face/snapshot): Used to manage a Snapshot for data migration across subscriptions.

<!-- Linguist question: Please confirm that the following are API names and should be left as is: "Person Management, LargePersonGroup/PersonGroup Management, LargeFaceList/FaceList Management, and Face Algorithms" -->
