# Start developing with Media Services v3 API using SDKs/tools

As a developer, you can use Media Services [REST API](https://aka.ms/ams-v3-rest-ref) or client libraries that allow you to interact with the REST API to easily create, manage, and maintain custom media workflows. The [Media Services v3](https://aka.ms/ams-v3-rest-sdk) API is based on the OpenAPI specification (formerly known as a Swagger).

This topic provides links to the SDKs, tools, documentation. It also provides some useful information for different dev env.

## Prerequisites

To start developing against Media Services, you need:

- An active Azure subscription. If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?ref=microsoft.com&utm_source=microsoft.com&utm_medium=docs&utm_campaign=visualstudio) before you begin.
- [Create a Media Services account](create-account-cli-how-to.md)

## Start developing

Azure Media Services supports the following SDKs/tools 

- [Azure CLI](https://aka.ms/ams-v3-cli) 
- [.NET SDK](https://aka.ms/ams-v3-dotnet-sdk)
- [Java SDK](https://aka.ms/ams-v3-java-sdk)
- [Node.js SDK](https://aka.ms/ams-v3-nodejs-sdk)
- [Python SDK](https://aka.ms/ams-v3-python-sdk)
- [Go SDK](https://aka.ms/ams-v3-go-sdk)
- [Ruby SDK](https://aka.ms/ams-v3-ruby-sdk)

### Azure Media Services Explorer

[Azure Media Services Explorer](https://github.com/Azure/Azure-Media-Services-Explorer) (AMSE) is a tool available to Windows customers who want to learn about Media Services. AMSE is a Winforms/C# application that does upload, download, encode, stream VOD and live content with Media Services. The AMSE tool is for clients who want to test Media Services without writing any code. The AMSE code is provided as a resource for customers who want to develop with Media Services.

AMSE is an Open Source project, support is provided by the community (issues can be reported to https://github.com/Azure/Azure-Media-Services-Explorer/issues). This project has adopted the [Microsoft Open Source Code of Conduct](https://opensource.microsoft.com/codeofconduct/). For more information see the [Code of Conduct FAQ](https://opensource.microsoft.com/codeofconduct/faq/) or contact opencode@microsoft.com with any additional questions or comments.

## REST

To start developing with the Media Services REST APIs, install a REST client. For example **Postman**, **Visual Studio Code** with the REST plugin, or **Telerik Fiddler**. We are using [Postman](media-rest-apis-with-postman.md) for Media Services v3 samples.
