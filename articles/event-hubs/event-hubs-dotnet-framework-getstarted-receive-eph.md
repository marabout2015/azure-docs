# Receive events from Azure Event Hubs using the .NET Framework

## Introduction

Event Hubs is a service that processes large amounts of event data (telemetry) from connected devices and applications. After you collect data into Event Hubs, you can store the data using a storage cluster or transform it using a real-time analytics provider. This large-scale event collection and processing capability is a key component of modern application architectures including the Internet of Things (IoT). For detailed overview of Event Hubs, see [Event Hubs overview](event-hubs-about.md) and [Event Hubs features](event-hubs-features.md).

This tutorial shows how to write a .NET Framework console application that receives messages from an event hub using the [Event Processor Host](event-hubs-event-processor-host.md). The [Event Processor Host](event-hubs-event-processor-host.md) is a .NET class that simplifies receiving events from event hubs by managing persistent checkpoints and parallel receives from those event hubs. Using the Event Processor Host, you can split events across multiple receivers, even when hosted in different nodes. This example shows how to use the Event Processor Host for a single receiver. The [Scale out event processing][Scale out Event Processing with Event Hubs] sample shows how to use the Event Processor Host with multiple receivers.

## Prerequisites

To complete this tutorial, you need the following prerequisites:

* [Microsoft Visual Studio 2017 or higher](https://visualstudio.com).

## Create an Event Hubs namespace and an event hub
The first step is to use the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) to create a namespace of type Event Hubs, and obtain the management credentials your application needs to communicate with the event hub. To create a namespace and an event hub, follow the procedure in [this article](event-hubs-create.md), then proceed with the following steps in this tutorial.

[!INCLUDE [event-hubs-create-storage](../../includes/event-hubs-create-storage.md)]

## Create a console application

In Visual Studio, create a new Visual C# Desktop App project using the **Console  Application** project template. Name the project **Receiver**.
   
![Create console application](./media/event-hubs-dotnet-framework-getstarted-receive-eph/create-receiver-csharp1.png)

## Add the Event Hubs NuGet package

1. In Solution Explorer, right-click the **Receiver** project, and then click **Manage NuGet Packages for Solution**.
2. Click the **Browse** tab, then search for `Microsoft Azure Service Bus Event Hub - EventProcessorHost`. Click **Install**, and accept the terms of use.
   
    ![Search for Event Processor Host NuGet package](./media/event-hubs-dotnet-framework-getstarted-receive-eph/create-eph-csharp1.png)
   
    Visual Studio downloads, installs, and adds a reference to the [Azure Service Bus Event Hub - EventProcessorHost NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.ServiceBus.EventProcessorHost), with all its dependencies.

## Implement the IEventProcessor interface

1. Right-click the **Receiver** project, click **Add**, and then click **Class**. Name the new class **SimpleEventProcessor**, and then click **Add** to create the class.
   
    ![Add SimpleEventProcessor class](./media/event-hubs-dotnet-framework-getstarted-receive-eph/create-receiver-csharp2.png)
2. Add the following statements at the top of the SimpleEventProcessor.cs file:
    
      ```csharp
      using Microsoft.ServiceBus.Messaging;
      using System.Diagnostics;
      ```
    
3. Substitute the following code for the body of the class:
    
      ```csharp
      class SimpleEventProcessor : IEventProcessor
      {
        Stopwatch checkpointStopWatch;
        
        async Task IEventProcessor.CloseAsync(PartitionContext context, CloseReason reason)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Processor Shutting Down. Partition '{0}', Reason: '{1}'.", context.Lease.PartitionId, reason);
            if (reason == CloseReason.Shutdown)
            {
                await context.CheckpointAsync();
            }
        }
        
        Task IEventProcessor.OpenAsync(PartitionContext context)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("SimpleEventProcessor initialized.  Partition: '{0}', Offset: '{1}'", context.Lease.PartitionId, context.Lease.Offset);
            this.checkpointStopWatch = new Stopwatch();
            this.checkpointStopWatch.Start();
            return Task.FromResult<object>(null);
        }
        
        async Task IEventProcessor.ProcessEventsAsync(PartitionContext context, IEnumerable<EventData> messages)
        {
            foreach (EventData eventData in messages)
            {
                string data = Encoding.UTF8.GetString(eventData.GetBytes());
        
                Console.WriteLine(string.Format("Message received.  Partition: '{0}', Data: '{1}'",
                    context.Lease.PartitionId, data));
            }
        
            //Call checkpoint every 5 minutes, so that worker can resume processing from 5 minutes back if it restarts.
            if (this.checkpointStopWatch.Elapsed > TimeSpan.FromMinutes(5))
            {
                await context.CheckpointAsync();
                this.checkpointStopWatch.Restart();
            }
        }
      }
      ```
    
      This class is called by the **EventProcessorHost** to process events received from the event hub. The `SimpleEventProcessor` class uses a stopwatch to periodically call the checkpoint method on the **EventProcessorHost** context. This processing ensures that, if the receiver is restarted, it loses no more than five minutes of processing work.

## Update the Main method to use SimpleEventProcessor

1. In the **Program** class, add the following `using` statement at the top of the file:
    
      ```csharp
      using Microsoft.ServiceBus.Messaging;
      ```
    
2. Replace the `Main` method in the `Program` class with the following code, substituting the event hub name and the namespace-level connection string that you saved previously, and the storage account and key that you copied in the previous sections. 
    
      ```csharp
      static void Main(string[] args)
      {
        string eventHubConnectionString = "{Event Hubs namespace connection string}";
        string eventHubName = "{Event Hub name}";
        string storageAccountName = "{storage account name}";
        string storageAccountKey = "{storage account key}";
        string storageConnectionString = string.Format("DefaultEndpointsProtocol=https;AccountName={0};AccountKey={1}", storageAccountName, storageAccountKey);
        
        string eventProcessorHostName = Guid.NewGuid().ToString();
        EventProcessorHost eventProcessorHost = new EventProcessorHost(eventProcessorHostName, eventHubName, EventHubConsumerGroup.DefaultGroupName, eventHubConnectionString, storageConnectionString);
        Console.WriteLine("Registering EventProcessor...");
        var options = new EventProcessorOptions();
        options.ExceptionReceived += (sender, e) => { Console.WriteLine(e.Exception); };
        eventProcessorHost.RegisterEventProcessorAsync<SimpleEventProcessor>(options).Wait();
        
        Console.WriteLine("Receiving. Press enter key to stop worker.");
        Console.ReadLine();
        eventProcessorHost.UnregisterEventProcessorAsync().Wait();
      }
      ```
    
3. Run the program, and ensure that there are no errors.
  
Congratulations! You have now received messages from an event hub using the Event Processor Host.


> [!NOTE]
> This tutorial uses a single instance of [EventProcessorHost](event-hubs-event-processor-host.md). To increase throughput, we recommend that you run multiple instances of [EventProcessorHost](event-hubs-event-processor-host.md), as shown in the [Scaled out event processing](https://code.msdn.microsoft.com/Service-Bus-Event-Hub-45f43fc3) sample. In those cases, the multiple instances automatically coordinate with each other to load balance the received events. 

## Next steps
In this quickstart, you created .NET Framework application that received messages from an event hub. To learn how to send events to an event hub using .NET Framework, see [Send events from event hub - .NET Framework](event-hubs-dotnet-framework-getstarted-send.md).
