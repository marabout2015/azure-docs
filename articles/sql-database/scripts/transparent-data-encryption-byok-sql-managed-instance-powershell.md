If you choose to install and use the PowerShell locally, this tutorial requires AZ PowerShell 1.4.0 or later. If you need to upgrade, see [Install Azure PowerShell module](/powershell/azure/install-az-ps). If you are running PowerShell locally, you also need to run `Connect-AzAccount` to create a connection with Azure.

If you choose to install and use the PowerShell locally, this tutorial also requires preview version of AzureRM.Sql PowerShell package *4.11.6-preview*. Run the following command to install it: `Install-Module -Name AzureRM.Sql -RequiredVersion 4.11.6-preview -AllowPrerelease`
